The time complexity of the iterative design for calculating the factorial of a positive integer is O(n), where n is the input number.
The time complexity of the recursive design for calculating the factorial of a positive integer is also O(n).
This is because each recursive call generates two more recursive calls, and the number of calls is proportional to the input number.
Time Complexity:
Iterative: O(n)
Recursive: O(n)

Space Complexity:
Iterative: O(1)
Recursive: O(n)
